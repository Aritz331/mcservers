ssh: 
  # Enables a SSH console for remote access to AutoPlug.
  # You can connect to it via any SSH client like Putty, a custom script, or the built-in SSH client in Windows, Linux distros, MacOS, etc.
  enabled: false
  # The port the SSH console listens on.
  # The default port is 22. Change it if you have a different port setup in your network, are hosting one or more other SSH-based services on the same port, or are otherwise using the default port for something else.
  port: 22
  # Select the authentication method for the SSH console.
  # Available options: 'user-pass-only', 'key-only', 'user-pass-key'.
  # user-pass-only: Requires a username and password to connect. Requires the username and password fields below.
  # key-only: Requires a public key to connect. Requires the allowed-keys-path field below.
  # user-pass-key: Requires either a username and password or a public key to connect. Requires all fields below.
  auth-method: key-only
  # The .txt file containing the public keys that are allowed to connect to the SSH console.
  # The file must contain one public key per line.
  # The file must be in the OpenSSH format.
  # Exaple:
  # ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABgQDf6... user@host
  # Create keys with 'ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096' and add them to the file.
  # The genereated file can be found in the .ssh directory of the user that created the key, unless a different path was specified.
  # The generated file will be a ____.pub file, which contains the public key.
  allowed-keys-path: 
  # The private key used by the server to authenticate itself to the SSH console.
  # The file must be in the OpenSSH format.
  # Create keys with 'ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096' and add them to the file.
  # The genereated file can be found in the .ssh directory of the user that created the key, unless a different path was specified.
  # The generated file will be a file with no extension, which contains the private key.
  server-private-key: 
  # The username required to connect to the SSH console.
  username: autoplug
  # The password is not encrypted and can be seen in plain text in this file.
  # It is recommended to change it to a secure password.
