    # The current user is used to register the script that is started on system boot.
    # The script is located at /autoplug/system and can be modified, but should not be renamed or have its path changed.
    # By default the script launches AutoPlug in the background without a terminal, thus its recommended to also enable the system-tray GUI to have access to the output.
    # If you have no GUI its recommended to install software like "screen" for virtual terminals and edit the script accordingly.
